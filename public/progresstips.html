    <ul class="tips">
      <li><span class="tipColor">Set doable goals.</span> For instance, aim to volunteer one day a month or to recruit one friend to volunteer with you. Once you achieve that goal, set a stretch goal, such as volunteering an extra day that month or enlisting more friends to get&nbsp;involved.

      <li><span class="tipColor">Find an accountability buddy.</span> Volunteering with friends is fun, especially helpful when trying times get you down. You can help keep each other motivated and remind each other of your commitment to enacting positive&nbsp;change.

      <li><span class="tipColor">Pace yourself.</span> It's easy to get super enthusiastic such that you expend a lot of energy at the outset, overcommitting to the point of burnout. It's OK to take a break. Prioritize self-care, whatever that looks like for&nbsp;you.

      <li><span class="tipColor">Be resilient in the face of failure.</span> Try not to take setbacks personally. Enacting change is a process. Inevitably you will take steps back but you will continue to forge&nbsp;forward.

      <li><span class="tipColor">Celebrate your victories</span> however insignificant they may seem in the grand scheme. Manage your expectations. Working within entrenched systems is difficult yet important. The mere act of doing something is worth celebrating. Reward yourself&nbsp;accordingly.

      <li><span class="tipColor">Don't waste your time</span> arguing with people on social media. Unless you really care about them. Even then, realize you might not get through to them. Project compassion. Spread&nbsp;facts.
